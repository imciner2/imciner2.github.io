I am a PhD student in the [High Performance Embedded and Distributed Systems (HiPEDS)](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/hipeds/) Centre for Doctoral Training at Imperial College London under the supervision of Dr. Eric Kerrigan and Professor George Constantinides.

## Research

My research focuses on the interaction between numerical algorithms, digital circuit design and control theory.
Specifically, I research how the calculations and computations required for advanced controllers (such as Model Predictive Control) can be implemented efficiently on digital platforms such as FPGAs.

<p class="list_header">Some key points I focus on in my research are:</p>
 <ul class="list_header">
    <li>Analyzing the effects of low precision computations on algorithmic stability/convergence.</li>
    <li>How to tailor algorithms to computational hardware (and vice-versa).</li>
</ul>
