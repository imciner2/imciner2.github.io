I am a research associate in the [Numerical Linear Algebra group](https://nla-group.org/) in the Department of Mathematics at The University of Manchester. I completed my PhD as part of the [High Performance Embedded and Distributed Systems (HiPEDS)](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/hipeds/) Centre for Doctoral Training at Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Eric Kerrigan and Prof. George Constantinides.
