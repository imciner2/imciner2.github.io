OSQP includes a code-generation facility to generate a light embeddable version of the solver, and the ability to compute derivatives of its solution with respect to the problem parameters. It uses a modular linear algebra framework to seamlessly run on three different platforms: default single-threaded for embedded applications, the Intel Math Kernel Library for multicore CPUs, and CUDA for GPUs. In this talk, we present the latest changes, improvements, and additions to OSQP. These include algorithmic improvements such as duality-gap termination criteria and step-size selection, improved GPU performance, and better integration with the language ecosystems of the three major high-level wrappers: Python, Julia and MATLAB.},

    abstract = {Loss of key personnel has always been a risk for research software projects. Key members of a team may have to step away due to a change in national or university funding, due to illness or burnout, or because they are simply changing jobs. Today, political and financial changes are putting large numbers of researchers out of work simultaneously, both in the UK and abroad, potentially leaving large amounts of research software abandoned and destabilising necessary digital research infrastructure. We present ten tips to help researchers ensure that the software they have built will continue to be usable after they have left their present job, for any reason. These techniques, methods, and best practices were collectively sourced from researchers from dozens of universities across the globe, and are now being improved upon in a ReSA Task Force. The tips shown here will enable individual researchers and labs to position their work in a way that makes it more sustainable and usable going forward, resulting in a more resilient research software ecosystem.},

    abstract = {In this talk, we present our recent work in the OSQP (Operator Splitting Quadratic Programming) solver that implements end-to-end acceleration of the solver on both GPU and FPGA platforms. At the core of this acceleration is a linear algebra abstraction layer that decouples the core optimization steps from numerical operations, enabling a unified OSQP solver API regardless of the computational backend. This layer allows for seamless backend selection at build-time, including CPU backends with sparse operations or Intel MKL, a GPU backend using cuSPARSE, and an FPGA backend using RSQP. OSQP libraries with these backends are packaged with high-level interfaces, such as the OSQP Julia and Python packages, enabling users to easily solve quadratic optimization problems on GPUs. Additionally, we will outline our current work on a computational backend using CUDA graphs, which aims to improve the performance of the GPU accelerated OSQP solver by reducing the amount of time spent in kernel launches and other CPU-based control tasks. We will present the overall architecture the graph-based solver uses, and discuss our experiences modifying the existing OSQP abstraction layer to support a graph-based compute backend.},

We discuss new OSQP code generation routines to create a light embeddable version of the solver. In contrast to prior OSQP code generation, our new implementation runs directly in C and can be called from any high level OSQP interface, including Python, Matlab, and Julia. In addition, OSQP now supports differentiable optimization and it can efficiently compute, directly in C, the derivatives of its solution with respect to the problem parameters. With convenient wrappers in JAX and Pytorch, OSQP is, to our knowledge, the first solver with internal automatic differentiation capabilities for the optimization problem itself. We illustrate the benefits of the new functionalities in OSQP on various numerical examples.},

    abstract = {In this talk, we present the ChopBLAS MATLAB library for simulating basic linear algebra operations using mixed precision and non-standard floating-point formats such as BFloat16, stochastic rounding, and custom formats. Existing simulation frameworks use MATLAB classes and operator overloading to implement custom precision data types, which makes implementing mixed-precision computations difficult and leads to decreased computational performance due to the overhead of MATLAB classes. Instead, ChopBLAS uses operation-level rounding, where instead of a custom data type, we store all data as double precision floating-point values, use double precision floating-point arithmetic, and then round the data to the desired precision using either the chop or cpfloat rounding function. By operating on double precision values we are able to exploit the built-in vectorization capabilities of MATLAB operations, leading to a speed-up of nearly 90x and 1050x when simulating stochastic rounding using chop and cpfloat, respectively, compared to a reference BLAS implementation in MATLAB with operation level rounding.},

    abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) with linear models and constraints is extensively being utilized in many applications, many of which have low power requirements and limited computational resources. In these resource-constrained environments, many designers choose to utilize simple iterative first-order optimization solvers, such as the Fast Gradient Method. Unfortunately, the convergence rate of these solvers is affected by the conditioning of the problem data, with ill-conditioned problems requiring a large number of iterations to solve. In order to reduce the number of solver iterations required,  we present a simple closed-form method for computing an optimal preconditioning matrix for the Hessian of the condensed primal problem. To accomplish this, we also derive spectral bounds for the Hessian in terms of the transfer function of the predicted system. This preconditioner is based on the Toeplitz structure of the Hessian and has equivalent performance to a state-of-the-art optimal preconditioner, without having to solve a semidefinite program during the design phase.},
