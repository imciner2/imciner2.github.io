    abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) with linear models and constraints is extensively being utilized in many applications, many of which have low power requirements and limited computational resources. In these resource-constrained environments, many designers choose to utilize simple iterative first-order optimization solvers, such as the Fast Gradient Method. Unfortunately, the convergence rate of these solvers is affected by the conditioning of the problem data, with ill-conditioned problems requiring a large number of iterations to solve. In order to reduce the number of solver iterations required,  we present a simple closed-form method for computing an optimal preconditioning matrix for the Hessian of the condensed primal problem. To accomplish this, we also derive spectral bounds for the Hessian in terms of the transfer function of the predicted system. This preconditioner is based on the Toeplitz structure of the Hessian and has equivalent performance to a state-of-the-art optimal preconditioner, without having to solve a semidefinite program during the design phase.},

    abstract = {We present an upper bound for the computational complexity of first-order optimization algorithms for constrained LQR problems with state, input and cross-term weights. We derive horizon-independent bounds on the condition number and extremal eigenvalues of the Hessian matrices via a system-theoretic analysis of appropriate Toeplitz operators. Comparing the iteration bounds with the closed-loop performance shows that small improvements in performance come at the expense of greatly increased computational cost.},
