I am a [Research Software Engineer](https://us-rse.org/blog/2019/vsoch/the-research-software-engineer/) in the [Vibration University Technology Centre (Vibration UTC)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/dynamics/vibration-utc/) and the [Dynamics research group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/dynamics/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London. I am responsible for the maintenance and ongoing development of software tools created by researchers in the Vibration UTC, and ensuring the successful transition of the software to industrial partners.

Previously, I was a research associate in the [Numerical Linear Algebra group](https://nla-group.org/) in the Department of Mathematics at The University of Manchester working with [Prof. Nicholas Higham](https://nhigham.com/) on numerical linear algebra topics such as mixed precision operations and stochastically rounded floating-point arithmetic. I completed my PhD as part of the [High Performance Embedded and Distributed Systems (HiPEDS)](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/hipeds/) Centre for Doctoral Training at Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Eric Kerrigan and Prof. George Constantinides with a focus on the implementation of Model Predictive Control on embedded systems and FPGAs.
