    abstract = {Iterative methods play an important role in science and engineering applications, with uses ranging from linear system solvers in finite element methods to optimization solvers in model predictive control. Recently, a new computational strategy for iterative methods called ARCHITECT was proposed by Li et al. in [1] that uses the redundant number representation to create "stable digits" in the Most-significant Digits (MSDs) of an iterate, allowing the future iterations to assume the stable MSDs have not changed their value, eliminating the need to recompute them. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of how these "stable digits" arise in iterative methods by showing that a Fej\'er monotone sequence in the redundant number representation can develop stable MSDs in the elements of the sequence as the sequence grows in length. This property of Fej\'er monotone sequences allows us to expand the class of iterative methods known to have MSD stability when using the redundant number representation to include any fixed-point iteration of a contractive Lipschitz continuous function. We then show that this allows for the theoretical guarantee of digit stability not just in the Jacobi method that was previously analyzed by Li et al. in [2], but also in other commonly used methods such as Newton's method.},

In this paper, we present an overview of the predictive control course taught by the authors at Imperial College London between 2018 and 2021. We discuss how the course evolved from focusing solely on the linear MPC formulation to covering nonlinear MPC and some of its extensions. We also present a novel specification-based summative assessment framework, written in MATLAB, that was developed to assess the knowledge and understanding of the students in the course by tasking them with designing a controller for a real-world problem. The MATLAB assessment framework was designed to provide the students with the freedom to design and implement any MPC controller they wanted. The submitted controllers were then assessed against over 30 variations of the real-world problem to gauge student understanding of design robustness and the MPC topics from the course.},

State-of-the-art methods invariably use fixed mesh schemes, which cannot achieve superlinear convergence in the presence of non-smooth solutions. In this paper, we propose using a flexible mesh in an integrated residual method. The locations of the mesh nodes are introduced as decision variables, and constraints are added to set upper and lower bounds on the size of the mesh intervals. We compare our approach to a uniform fixed mesh on a real-world satellite reorientation example. This sample problem demonstrates that the flexible mesh enables the solver to automatically locate the discontinuities in the solution, and have a superlinear order of convergence and faster solve time.},

    abstract = {There has been an increased interest in controlling complex systems using Model Predictive Control (MPC). However, the use of resource-constrained computing platforms in these systems has slowed the adoption of MPC. This thesis focuses on increasing the efficiency of numerical methods for MPC in terms of resource usage and solution time, while also simplifying the design process.

We first show how block Toeplitz operators can be used to link the linear MPC matrices to the transfer function of the predicted system, resulting in horizon-independent bounds on the condition number of the condensed Hessian and the upper iteration bound for the Fast Gradient Method (FGM). We derive a horizon-independent preconditioner that produces up to a 9x speedup for the FGM while reducing the preconditioner computation time by up to 50,000x compared to an existing preconditioner. We propose a new method for computing the minimum number of fractional bits needed to ensure the FGM with fixed-point arithmetic is stable, with an example showing decreases of up to 77\% in resource usage and 50\% in the computational energy when using this method on a Field Programmable Gate Array.

Finally, we present a framework using the derivative-free Mesh Adaptive Direct Search method to solve nonlinear MPC problems with non-differentiable features or quantized variables without the need for complex or costly reformulations. We augment the system dynamics with additional states to compute the Lagrange cost term and the violation of the path constraints along the state trajectory, and then perform a structured search of the input space using a single-shooting simulation of the system dynamics. We demonstrate this framework on a robust Goddard rocket problem with a non-differentiable cost and a quantized thrust input, where we achieve an altitude within 40\,m of the target, while other methods are unable to get closer than 180m.},

    abstract = {First-order optimization solvers, such as the Fast Gradient Method, are increasingly being used to solve Model Predictive Control problems in resource-constrained environments. Unfortunately, the convergence rate of these solvers is significantly affected by the conditioning of the problem data, with ill-conditioned problems requiring a large number of iterations. To reduce the number of iterations required, we present a simple method for computing a horizon-independent preconditioning matrix for the Hessian of the condensed problem. The preconditioner is based on the block Toeplitz structure of the Hessian. Horizon-independence allows one to use only the predicted system and cost matrices to compute the preconditioner, instead of the full Hessian. The proposed preconditioner has equivalent performance to an optimal preconditioner in numerical examples, producing speedups between 2x and 9x for the Fast Gradient Method. Additionally, we derive horizon-independent spectral bounds for the Hessian in terms of the transfer function of the predicted system, and show how these can be used to compute a novel horizon-independent bound on the condition number for the preconditioned Hessian.},

    abstract={The use of derivative-based solvers to compute solutions to optimal control problems with non-differentiable cost or dynamics often requires reformulations or relaxations that complicate the implementation or increase computational complexity. We present an initial framework for using the derivative-free Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm to solve Nonlinear Model Predictive Control problems with non-differentiable features without the need for reformulation. The MADS algorithm performs a structured search of the input space by simulating selected system trajectories and computing the subsequent cost value. We propose handling the path constraints and the Lagrange cost term by augmenting the system dynamics with additional states to compute the violation and cost value alongside the state trajectories, eliminating the need for reconstructing the state trajectories in a separate phase. We demonstrate the practicality of this framework by solving a robust rocket control problem, where the objective is to reach a target altitude as close as possible, given a system with uncertain parameters. This example uses a non-differentiable cost function and simulates two different system trajectories simultaneously, with each system having its own free final time.},

    abstract = {In our recent work on iterative computation in hardware, we showed that arbitrary-precision solvers can perform more favourably than their traditional arithmetic equivalents when the latter's precisions are either under- or over-budgeted for the solution of the problem at hand. Significant proportions of these performance improvements stem from the ability to infer the existence of identical most-significant digits between iterations. This technique uses properties of algorithms operating on redundantly represented numbers to allow the generation of those digits to be skipped, increasing efficiency. It is unable, however, to guarantee that digits will stabilise, i.e. never change in any future iteration. In this article, we address this shortcoming, using interval and forward error analyses to prove that digits of high significance will become stable when computing the approximants of systems of linear equations using stationary iterative methods. We formalise the relationship between matrix conditioning and the rate of growth in most-significant digit stability, using this information to converge to our desired results more quickly. Versus our previous work, an exemplary hardware implementation of this new technique achieves an up-to 2.2x speedup in the solution of a set of variously conditioned systems using the Jacobi method.},

    abstract = {This paper presents an energy regulator based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for a Voltage Source Converter (VSC). The MPC is formulated to optimise the converter performance according to the weights defined in an objective function that trades off additional features, such as current harmonic distortion, reactive power tracking and DC bus voltage oscillation. Differently from most approaches found in the research literature, the MPC proposed here considers the coupling dynamics between the AC and DC sides of the VSC. This study is focused on the example case of a single-phase VSC, which presents a nonlinear relationship between its AC and DC sides and a sustained double-line frequency power disturbance in its DC bus. To reduce the burden of the MPC, the controller is formulated to benefit from the slow energy dynamics of the system. Thus, the cascaded structure typically used in the control of VSCs is kept and the MPC is set as an energy regulator at a reduced sampling frequency while the current control relies on a fast inner controller. The computational burden of the algorithm is further reduced by using a linear time-varying approximation. The controller is presented in detail and experimental validation showing the performance of the algorithm is provided.},

We derive two models for the round-off error present in fixed-point arithmetic. The first is a generic model with no assumptions on the predicted system or weight matrices. The second is a parametric model that exploits the Toeplitz structure of the MPC problem for a Schur-stable system. We also propose a metric for measuring the amount of round-off error the FGM iteration can tolerate before becoming unstable. This metric is combined with the round-off error models to compute the minimum number of fractional bits needed for the fixed-point data type. Using these models, we show that exploiting the MPC problem structure nearly halves the number of fractional bits needed to implement an example problem. We show that this results in significant decreases in resource usage, computational energy and execution time for an implementation on a Field Programmable Gate Array.},

    abstract = {We present a framework for upper bounding the number of iterations required by first-order optimization algorithms implementing constrained LQR controllers. We derive new bounds for the condition number and extremal eigenvalues of the primal and dual Hessian matrices when the cost function is scaled. These bounds are horizon-independent, allowing for their use with receding, variable and decreasing horizon controllers. We considerably relax prior assumptions on the structure of the weight matrices and assume only that the system is Schur-stable and the primal Hessian of the quadratic program (QP) is positive-definite. Our analysis uses the Toeplitz structure of the QP matrices to relate their spectrum to the transfer function of the system, allowing for the use of system-theoretic techniques to compute the bounds. Using these bounds, we can compute the effect on the computational complexity of trading off the input energy used against the state deviation. An example system shows a three-times increase in algorithm iterations between the two extremes, with the state 2-norm decreased by only 5% despite a greatly increased state deviation penalty.},

Many existing testbeds already exist, but the majority of them utilize expensive quadrotors for their agents. With the recent surge in interest from consumers, companies have started to market lower cost quadrotor options. One such option is the Crazyflie 2.0 from Bitcraze. This quadrotor measures just 10cm from rotor to rotor, uses open-source firmware, and has developed a strong community backing. This work develops a multi-agent testbed using the Crazyflie 2.0.

Additionally, this work discusses the default control loop of the Crazyflie 2.0. Then nested-loop PID controllers are designed and compared against the simulated physics model.
    <p>A software system that is capable of controlling multiple flying Crazyflie's is also presented. This system is also capable of modifying the controller at runtime, and implementing distributed computation on the Crazyflie.
    <p>Finally, a novel algorithm for localization of a target object using distance-only measurements is presented. This algorithm uses optimization dynamics to solve a non-convex QCQP formulation of the problem in a distributed manner.
